title: I found the commit and want to restore it
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Once you find the changes you are interested in, there are several ways you can proceed. You can `git reset --hard SHA` your current branch to the history and current state of that SHA (probably not recommended for stashes), you can `git branch newbranch SHA` to link the old history to a new branch name (also not recommended for stashes), you can `git stash apply SHA` (for the non-index commit in a git-stash), you can `git stash merge SHA` or `git cherry-pick SHA` (for either part of a stash or non-stashes), etc.
